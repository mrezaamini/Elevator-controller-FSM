# ELEVATOR CONTROLLER FSM IMPLEMENTATION (VHDL)
In this project, I implemented a simple finite state machine of a 4-floor elevator using VHDL. It's a good example to see how you can implement finite state machines in VHDL. There's an extra part in this implementation that uses text file input as testbench that is described in the test part below.
